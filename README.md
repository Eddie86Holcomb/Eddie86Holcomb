## Hi there 👋

👋 Hey there! I'm an aspiring Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) diving into the world of incident response and observability tools. This repository is part of my learning journey—documenting experiments, small projects, and best practices as I explore what it takes to keep systems reliable, scalable, and resilient.

My focus right now is on understanding how to detect, respond to, and learn from incidents in real-world systems. I'm studying incident management workflows, setting up mock failure scenarios, and practicing response strategies. The goal is to build muscle memory for high-pressure situations while also learning how to minimize downtime and improve service reliability.

In parallel, I'm getting hands-on with observability stacks—tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Loki, and Jaeger. I’m learning how to instrument services, visualize metrics, track logs, and trace requests across distributed systems. This repo includes configuration files, dashboards, and example setups that I’ve built while experimenting with these tools.

Beyond just collecting data, I’m also exploring how to derive actionable insights from it. Whether it’s setting up alerting rules, creating SLOs/SLIs, or analyzing incident timelines, I want to understand how observability ties directly into system reliability and team effectiveness.

This repository is meant to be a living notebook—open to iteration, improvement, and collaboration. If you're also exploring SRE practices or just curious about how observability fits into modern infrastructure, feel free to look around, clone, or contribute. I’d love to connect with others on a similar path.

Thanks for checking it out! Stay reliable. ⚙️📊🛠️
